    so now you have click to this article then it means you want to build your dream pc 
    to build that dream pc you have to give  a graphics card.
    [note:all the budget i will say it will e only the price of graphics ard]
    so,lets get on to the point</p></div>
   <div class="h1"> <h2 class="500$">if your budget is about 500$ 
    </h2></div>
    <p>if you want a intermideate fps like 60 to 100 fps graphic card 
        in high end games then if prices are low at your time,then you can take rtx 3060 
       but if your budget is 500$ in 2021 then you can take Gtx1660,Gtx1660 super or gtx 1650.
        means at 2021 you can only GTX series 
        I know this is a dissopinment because when the RTX 30series 
        the rtx 3060 pricing was fixed in 500$ 
        </p>
        <h2>If your budget is 100$</h2>
        <p>In this budget you can buy rtx 2070,2080or RTX 3060, Rtx 3070
            unforrtuntly rtx 3080 and rtx390 is not getting easly because there is sortage of rtx 3080 and rtx3090
            </p>
