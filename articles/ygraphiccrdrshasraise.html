    <title>Why the NVIDIA Graphics card so expensive</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>why NVIDIA Graphics card are so expensive</h1>
    <h2>there are so many reasons why Graphics are so expensive</h2>
    <h3>First reason</h3>
    <p>GPUs or graphic card are so expensive because their supply is well blow their demand. Demand of GPUs shot up with the value of crypto curriencies. Mining bitcons and the like has become more profitable,and GPUs are the best hardware for Mining. This is due to GPU mining </p>
    <h3>One of the Major reasons</h3>
    <p>One of the major reasons graphics cards are getting so expensive is that they are of higher quality than they have been in the past. The increase in quality is not going to be the only reason for raising the price. Most of the time, a product that contains better technology is also going to be harder to manufacture.</p>
    <h3>third reason</h3>
    <p>Nvidia and AMD's latest GPUs were nearly impossible to buy in 2020 to begin with, as COVID-19 affected manufacturing and supply chains. Retailers typically sold out in mere seconds every time they restocked, no thanks to scalpers and cryptocurrency miners that used bots to buy up as many graphics cards as possible</p>
    <h3>so these are the reasons according to my knowledge </h3>
